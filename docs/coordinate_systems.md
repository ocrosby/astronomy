# Coordinate Systems

Coordinate systems are utilized to specify the position of objects in a 3D space.

Types of coordinate systems:

- Helio-centric (based on the Sun)
- Geo-centric (based on the Earth)

Ecliptic Coordinates
: locates a point to the plane of the earth's orbit

Equatorial Coordinates
: locates a point relative to the position of the Earth's or celestial equators

Precession
: the gradual change or "wobble" in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis.

For Earth, precession is known as the `precession of the equinoxes`, which is caused by gravitational forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge.
This results in a slow, continuous change in the orientation of Earth's axis over a period of approximately 26,000 years.


Newton's 2nd law of motion with vector quantities is given by:
$$
\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}
$$
where \( $\mathbf{F}$ \) is the force vector, \( m \) is the mass, and \( $\mathbf{a}$ \) is the acceleration vector.

Newton's law of universal gravitation with vector quantities is given by:
$$
\mathbf{F} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$
where \( $\mathbf{F}$ \) is the gravitational force vector, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the two objects, \( r \) is the distance between the two objects, and \( $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ \) is the unit vector in the direction of the force.
